# ft_containers

In this project, I had implemented a few container types from the C++ standard template library. I had to take the structure of each standard container as a reference.
If a part of the Orthodox Canonical form was missing in it, I did not implement it.
As a reminder, I had to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated ones) is expected.

### List of containers

- Map
- Set
- Stack
- Vector
